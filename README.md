## Why make

This project allows users to use Google Carotographer library with much more ease than before - needing to only make a config and upload some data via our java / cpp. This projecty is also very useful if you want to use google cartographer library with Java - a task previously not possible. However, you are limited to a few basic features that may be updated later on.
